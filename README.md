# Skill Swap Platform – Odoo-hackathon-2025

In a world overflowing with talent but limited by access, many people struggle to find people they can collaborate with who possess the skills they seek for. 

# SwapVerse
We present our solution, SwapVerse ! It is a peer-powered skill exchange platform that connects learners and mentors in a seamless and community-driven environment.  It empowers individuals to offer and request skills in return, facilitating meaningful learning through community interaction. Whether you're a coding enthusiast, a design guru, or a storytelling wizard — SwapVerse creates a dynamic ecosystem where users learn by sharing what they know.

This platform was developed as part of Odoo Hackathon 2025 by Team Sparkle Stack, with a vision to redefine how people share, teach, and acquire skills in today’s fast-evolving world.
